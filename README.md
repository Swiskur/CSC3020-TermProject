Schaefer Wiskur - Modern Technologies CSC 3020

The Pitching Velocity Journal - The user will input their velocities from their throwing session, and it will keep track of their data. There will also be a journal section where the pitcher can write about the session such as what they felt, how they thought it went, etc. It solves the problem for pitchers not having an easy place to track their progress and take note of their performance to remember an outing or session to repeat the good and learn from the bad.
